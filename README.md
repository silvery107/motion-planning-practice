## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silvery107/kinodynamic-rrt-pybullet.git
    ```

2. Install required python packages
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

3. Run the hovercraft demo!
    ```bash
    python demo.py # default to Kinodynamic RRT
    ```
    Choose a different planning algorithm by setting `--algo`, choices are `["RRT", "BiRRT", "KdRRT", "Astar", "BiKdRRT"]`.

4. Customize your maze. Just edit the maze matrix in `maze_layout.json` and have fun.
   Make sure the goal (shown in green) is feasible.

5. Run the KUKA iiwa arm demo!
    ```bash
    python demo_kuka.py # default to Bidirectional RRT
    ```
    Choose a different planning algorithm by setting `--algo`, choices are `["RRT", "BiRRT"]`.
    The start and goal joint configurations are solved through iterative IK from task space positions.

### Known Issues
- Nonlinear state steering could fail due to the kinodynamic infeasibility.
- Iterative IK solver can converge to sub-optimal solutions due to joint limits, singularities or different initial guesses.
